## Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "dompurify": "^3.x.x",
  "@types/dompurify": "^3.x.x"
}
```

## Configuration Changes

### Security Headers (vercel.json) - Already in place ‚úÖ
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy

### Rate Limiting (server-dev.cjs) - New ‚úÖ

## Known Remaining Issues

### Dependency Vulnerabilities (Non-Critical):

1. **d3-color** (ReDoS vulnerability)
   - Severity: High
   - Impact: Low (used in maps visualization only)
   - Action: Monitor for updates
   - Mitigation: Not exposed to user input

2. **next.js** (Cache key confusion, SSRF)
   - Severity: Moderate
   - Impact: Low (Next.js not heavily used)
   - Action: Update when fix available
   - Mitigation: Limited Next.js usage

3. **xlsx** (Prototype pollution, ReDoS)
   - Severity: High
   - Impact: Medium (used in import feature)
   - Action: No fix available yet
   - Mitigation: File size limits, file type validation

**Note:** These are library-level vulnerabilities with low actual risk in this application context. All have mitigations in place.

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Review all changes
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Test file uploads
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Test admin access controls
- [ ] Verify email forms work correctly
- [ ] Check error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Monitor logs after deployment

---

## Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Failed login attempts** - Check for brute force
2. **Rate limit hits** - Monitor for DDoS attempts
3. **File upload errors** - Check for malicious upload attempts
4. **Admin access attempts** - Verify authorization working
5. **Database errors** - Check for injection attempts
