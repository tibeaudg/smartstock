Step 2: The "V" Structure Your "Retail Price" page worked because it was simple and definitional. Replicate that structure but add your unique value (the "Bridge").

Top of Page (The Hook): Direct answer to the query (Definition/Formula). Do not fluff this up.

Middle (The Meat): The "Missing Link" you found in Step 1.

Example: Everyone says "EOQ helps you save money." You write: "Why EOQ fails if your lead times are inconsistent."

Bottom (The Bridge): Connect it to your software.

Example: "You can calculate this manually, but if a supplier is late, your math breaks. Our tool auto-adjusts EOQ based on real delivery times."




Prompt for Structure: "Rewrite the above data into a new better optimized seo article"

Bad: "For example, a shoe store..." (Generic AI hallucination).

Good: "For example, one of our users managing 500 SKUs saw..." (Real authority).
