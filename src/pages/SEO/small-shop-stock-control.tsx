      question: "What is stock control and why is it important for small shops?",
      answer: "Stock control is the process of managing inventory levels to ensure you have the right products available when customers need them. For small shops, effective stock control prevents stockouts that lose sales, reduces overstock that ties up cash, and helps maintain healthy profit margins."
    },
    {
      question: "How can small shops implement effective stock control without expensive systems?",
      answer: "StockFlow offers affordable stock control solutions specifically designed for small shops. Start with basic tracking features, set minimum stock levels, and use barcode scanning for accuracy. The system grows with your business without requiring large upfront investments."

        question: "What are the most common stock control mistakes small shops make?",
        answer: "Common mistakes include not setting minimum stock levels, failing to track fast-moving items, relying on manual counting, ignoring seasonal trends, and not analyzing which products are most profitable. Our system helps avoid these pitfalls."
      }
    },
    {
      question: "How often should small shops check their stock levels?",
      answer: "Daily monitoring is ideal for fast-moving items, while slower-moving inventory can be checked weekly. StockFlow provides real-time updates and alerts, so you always know your current stock levels without manual checking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can stock control help small shops compete with larger retailers?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Effective stock control helps small shops maintain better customer service by avoiding stockouts, reduces costs through optimized inventory levels, and provides insights to make smarter purchasing decisions. This levels the playing field with larger competitors."
