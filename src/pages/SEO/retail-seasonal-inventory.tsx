      question: "What is seasonal inventory management and why is it important for retail?",
      answer: "Seasonal inventory management involves planning and managing stock levels based on seasonal demand patterns. It's crucial for retail businesses because demand for products varies significantly throughout the year. Effective seasonal management helps you stock up before peak seasons, avoid overstock during slow periods, and maximize profits during high-demand periods."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I predict seasonal demand for my retail business?",
      answer: "StockFlow's seasonal inventory management uses historical sales data, market trends, and predictive analytics to forecast seasonal demand. The system analyzes your past sales patterns, identifies seasonal trends, and provides recommendations for optimal stock levels throughout the year."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the main seasonal periods that retail businesses need to plan for?",
      answer: "Key seasonal periods include: Holiday season (November-December), Back-to-school (August-September), Summer season (June-August), Spring cleaning (March-May), Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Each season requires different inventory strategies and planning."
    },
    {
      question: "How can seasonal inventory management help reduce costs?",
      answer: "Effective seasonal management prevents overstocking during slow periods (reducing carrying costs) and ensures adequate stock during peak seasons (preventing lost sales). It also helps optimize purchasing timing, negotiate better supplier terms, and improve cash flow management throughout the year."
    },
    {
      question: "Can seasonal inventory management help with clearance and markdowns?",
      answer: "Yes! The system tracks seasonal product lifecycles and alerts you when items are approaching their seasonal end. This helps you plan clearance sales, markdowns, and promotional strategies to move seasonal inventory before it becomes obsolete."
