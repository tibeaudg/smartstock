      question: "What is multi-location retail management and why is it important?",
      answer: "Multi-location retail management allows you to manage inventory, sales, and operations across multiple store locations from a single dashboard. It's essential for retail chains, franchises, and businesses with multiple outlets to maintain consistent operations, optimize stock levels, and ensure all locations have the right products at the right time."
    },
    {
      question: "How does multi-location inventory management work?",
      answer: "Multi-location inventory management provides centralized control over all your store locations. You can transfer stock between locations, view real-time inventory across all stores, set location-specific reorder points, and generate consolidated reports. This helps optimize inventory distribution and reduce overall carrying costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I transfer inventory between different store locations?",
      answer: "Yes! StockFlow's multi-location management includes built-in transfer functionality. You can easily move products between locations, track transfer history, and set up automatic reorder rules based on sales patterns at each location."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle different pricing or promotions across locations?",
      answer: "Multi-location management allows you to set location-specific pricing, promotions, and discounts. You can also apply company-wide promotions or customize offers for specific markets while maintaining centralized control over your pricing strategy."
    },
    {
      question: "What reporting features are available for multi-location businesses?",
      answer: "Get comprehensive reports including location-specific sales performance, inventory turnover by store, transfer reports, and consolidated analytics. Compare performance across locations, identify top-performing stores, and make data-driven decisions for your entire retail network."
